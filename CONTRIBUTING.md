# Contributing

First of all, a huge thank you for looking to contribute to this repository! This project was concieved and built at [FOSS Hack 4.0](https://fossunited.org/fosshack/2024), a hackathon for building open-source software. As such, everything from the folder structure to the code has been *hacked up* in a couple of hours. That is to say, this is messed up lol. There's tons of stuff to improve.

## Improvements
These are some of the stuff that we'd like to improve upon. 

### Switch to a different framework?
Sure, why not! As said earlier, this was hacked up and we're not sure this is the best approach to build this portal. Right now, it works and that's all we know! If you find a way to overhaul it and make it better, maybe with a different framework, please do so and open a PR!

> Note: If your work requires any changes with the API, please coordinate with us by [messaging me on telegram](https://t.me/vishalds/).

### I'll write with pure HTML, CSS & JS
Well get on it gigachad! We'll 100% take your solution over any framework. But if you're doing stuff like this, please make sure to maintain code quality.

### Improve code quality
If you can find places to refactor, improve code quality, or do any such thing, feel free to open a PR. We appreciate better and simpler code.

## How to contribute?
Simple, just open a PR. Let the checks run. If the build check is successful and your description conveys the intent, then we'll probably merge it.

You can also open an issue if you spot one.

## Merging right now...
Right now, the evaluation for FOSS Hack is still ongoing. As such, we won't be merging any PR's until August 20, 2024. But feel free to open one, we'll merge once the evaluation finishes.
